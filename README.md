# 3D Architectural Primitive Modeler

A simple 3D web application built with **Three.js** that allows users to create, manipulate, and position basic architectural primitives (cubes, cylinders, etc.) in a 3D space.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D Scene**: Create and manipulate objects in real-time.
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Ensures structured object placement.
- **Collision Handling**: Prevents object overlap while allowing stacking.
- **Object Transformations**: Supports translation, rotation, and scaling.
- **Camera Controls**: Navigate the scene smoothly using OrbitControls.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Three.js** (for 3D rendering)
- **JavaScript** (for interactivity)
- **Vector Mathematics & Linear Algebra** (for spatial calculations)
